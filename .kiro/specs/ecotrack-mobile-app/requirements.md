# Requirements Document

## Introduction

EcoTrack is a B2B SaaS platform for waste collection and recycling management that requires mobile applications for both drivers and customers. The mobile app will be built using React Native with Expo, providing separate interfaces for waste collection drivers and business customers. The app focuses on streamlining waste collection operations, improving customer experience, and providing educational resources for proper waste sorting.

3. WHEN the driver selects a job THEN the system SHALL display detailed information including customer contact, special instructions, and estimated waste volume
4. WHEN there are no scheduled jobs THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a waste collection driver, I want to view optimized routes on a map, so that I can navigate efficiently between pickup locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the driver accesses the route map THEN the system SHALL display all scheduled pickups as markers on a map
2. WHEN displaying routes THEN the system SHALL show an optimized path connecting all pickup locations
3. WHEN the driver selects a pickup marker THEN the system SHALL display job details in a popup
4. WHEN GPS is available THEN the system SHALL show the driver's current location on the map
5. IF GPS is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display mock route data for testing purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a waste collection driver, I want to scan QR codes or barcodes on bins, so that I can accurately track which containers have been collected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the driver initiates scanning THEN the system SHALL open the device camera with scanning overlay
2. WHEN a valid QR code or barcode is detected THEN the system SHALL capture the code data and associate it with the current job
3. WHEN scanning is complete THEN the system SHALL update the job status and provide visual confirmation
4. IF the camera is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide manual entry option as fallback
5. WHEN using placeholder functionality THEN the system SHALL simulate successful scans for testing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a waste collection driver, I want to take photos as proof of collection, so that I can document completed pickups for customer records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the driver selects photo capture THEN the system SHALL open the device camera
2. WHEN a photo is taken THEN the system SHALL associate the image with the current pickup job
3. WHEN photos are captured THEN the system SHALL allow multiple photos per job
4. WHEN photos are saved THEN the system SHALL provide thumbnail preview and deletion option
5. WHEN the device camera is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a waste collection driver, I want to access my job list offline, so that I can continue working in areas with poor network connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts with network connectivity THEN the system SHALL cache job data locally
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL continue displaying cached job information
3. WHEN working offline THEN the system SHALL allow job status updates and photo capture
4. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL sync offline changes with the server
5. WHEN cache is empty and offline THEN the system SHALL display appropriate offline message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business customer, I want to request new waste pickups, so that I can schedule collection services when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the customer accesses pickup request THEN the system SHALL display a form with waste type, quantity, and preferred time options
2. WHEN submitting a request THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and show confirmation
3. WHEN requesting bulk disposal THEN the system SHALL provide additional options for large volume waste
4. WHEN the request is submitted THEN the system SHALL generate a unique request ID for tracking
5. WHEN using mock data THEN the system SHALL simulate successful request submission

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business customer, I want to view upcoming pickups and receive notifications, so that I can prepare waste for collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the customer opens the schedule screen THEN the system SHALL display upcoming pickup appointments
2. WHEN pickups are scheduled THEN the system SHALL show date, time, waste type, and collection status
3. WHEN notifications are enabled THEN the system SHALL send mock notifications for upcoming pickups
4. WHEN a pickup is completed THEN the system SHALL update the status and notify the customer
5. WHEN there are no scheduled pickups THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty state

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a business customer, I want to rate collection services and provide feedback, so that I can help improve service quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pickup is completed THEN the system SHALL prompt the customer for rating and feedback
2. WHEN providing feedback THEN the system SHALL allow star rating (1-5) and optional text comments
3. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL confirm submission and thank the customer
4. WHEN viewing feedback history THEN the system SHALL display previous ratings and comments
5. WHEN using mock data THEN the system SHALL simulate feedback submission and storage

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a business customer, I want to access waste sorting tips, so that I can properly separate recyclables and improve environmental impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the customer accesses sorting tips THEN the system SHALL display educational content about waste categories
2. WHEN viewing tips THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual guides for different waste types
3. WHEN browsing content THEN the system SHALL organize tips by waste category (plastic, paper, organic, etc.)
4. WHEN tips are displayed THEN the system SHALL include local recycling guidelines and best practices
5. WHEN content is updated THEN the system SHALL highlight new or changed sorting information

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user of either app, I want intuitive navigation between screens, so that I can efficiently access all app features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display appropriate bottom tab navigation for the user role
2. WHEN navigating between screens THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent UI patterns and styling
3. WHEN using driver app THEN the system SHALL provide tabs for Jobs, Routes, Scanner, and Profile
