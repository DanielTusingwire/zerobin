# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Install and configure gesture handling dependencies



  - Install react-native-gesture-handler and react-native-reanimated packages
  - Configure native dependencies for iOS and Android
  - Set up gesture handler provider in app root
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_


- [x] 2. Create InteractiveBottomSheet component foundation


  - Create new component file with TypeScript interfaces
  - Implement basic component structure with props validation
  - Set up initial state management for modal height and animation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1_

- [x] 3. Implement gesture recognition system



  - Add PanGestureHandler for drag detection
  - Implement gesture event handlers for drag start, update, and end
  - Add gesture state management and velocity tracking

  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1_

- [x] 4. Create smooth animation system




  - Implement spring-based animations using react-native-reanimated
  - Configure animation physics (damping, stiffness, mass)
  - Add animation state tracking and interruption handling
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 5. Implement snap point logic



  - Define snap point configuration (minimum, standard, maximum heights)
  - Create snap-to-position calculation logic based on drag velocity and position
  - Implement rubber band effect for over-drag scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Enhance drag handle with visual feedback



  - Update handle component with touch feedback states
  - Add scale and opacity animations on touch
  - Implement haptic feedback for drag interactions
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 7. Create content adaptation system





  - Implement height-based content mode switching (compact/standard/expanded)
  - Create responsive layouts for different modal heights
  - Add content scrolling behavior within modal constraints
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Integrate InteractiveBottomSheet into request flow



  - Replace existing bottom sheet in CustomerRequestScreen
  - Configure snap points and initial height for request flow
  - Ensure step content renders correctly in new modal system
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 9. Handle gesture conflicts with scroll content
  - Implement gesture priority system between modal drag and content scroll
  - Add logic to prevent modal drag when content is scrollable
  - Test and fix edge cases with simultaneous gestures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 10. Add performance optimizations
  - Use native animation driver where possible
  - Implement gesture debouncing for smooth performance
  - Optimize component re-renders during drag operations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 11. Implement accessibility features
  - Add screen reader support for modal height changes
  - Provide alternative interaction methods for users with motor impairments
  - Add voice-over announcements for state changes
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 12. Create comprehensive test suite
  - Write unit tests for gesture handling logic
  - Add integration tests for modal interaction with step content
  - Create visual regression tests for different modal heights
  - Test performance and animation smoothness across devices
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2_
