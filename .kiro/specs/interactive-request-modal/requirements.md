# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the customer request flow modal by making it interactive and user-controllable. Users will be able to drag the modal up and down to adjust its height, providing a smooth and intuitive experience when viewing request steps and content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to drag the request flow modal up and down, so that I can control how much content I see and have a better viewing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user touches the modal handle THEN the system SHALL allow dragging gestures
2. WHEN the user drags upward THEN the modal SHALL expand smoothly to show more content
3. WHEN the user drags downward THEN the modal SHALL contract smoothly to show less content
4. WHEN the user releases the drag THEN the modal SHALL snap to the nearest logical position
5. IF the user drags beyond maximum height THEN the modal SHALL resist further expansion with rubber band effect

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the modal to respond smoothly to my gestures, so that the interaction feels natural and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user performs drag gestures THEN the modal SHALL respond with smooth animations at 60fps
2. WHEN the user releases a drag THEN the modal SHALL animate to final position with easing
3. WHEN the modal is animating THEN the content SHALL remain readable and properly positioned
4. IF the user interrupts an animation with a new gesture THEN the system SHALL immediately respond to the new input

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want visual feedback during modal interactions, so that I understand what actions are available and the current state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal is draggable THEN the system SHALL show a visual handle or indicator
2. WHEN the user starts dragging THEN the handle SHALL provide visual feedback (color change, scale, etc.)
3. WHEN the modal reaches minimum or maximum height THEN the system SHALL provide visual indication
4. WHEN the modal is in different states THEN the content SHALL adjust appropriately to the available space

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the modal to have logical height constraints, so that it doesn't become unusable or cover important UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal is at minimum height THEN it SHALL show at least the header and key information
2. WHEN the modal is at maximum height THEN it SHALL not cover critical navigation elements
3. WHEN the modal height changes THEN the content SHALL scroll or adjust to fit the available space
4. IF the content is longer than the modal height THEN the system SHALL provide scrolling within the modal
